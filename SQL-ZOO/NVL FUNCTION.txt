NVL
NVL takes two arguments and returns the first value that is not null.

   NVL(x,y) = x if x is not NULL
   NVL(x,y) = y if x is NULL
1.
NVL can be useful when you want to replace a NULL value with some other value. In this example you show the name of the party for each MSP that has a party. For the MSP with no party (such as Canavan, Dennis) you show the string None.

SELECT name, party
      ,COALESCE(party,'None') AS aff
  FROM msp WHERE name LIKE 'C%'


Result:
name	party	aff
Campbell MSP, Colin	SNP	SNP
Canavan MSP, Dennis		None
Chisholm MSP, Malcolm	Lab	Lab
Craigie MSP, Cathie	Lab	Lab
Crawford JP MSP, Bruce	SNP	SNP
Cunningham MSP, Roseanna	SNP	SNP
Curran MSP, Ms Margaret	Lab	Lab
